# Debugging

Using source maps
-----------------

To enable source map support for your WebAssembly binary for example for more convenient error reporting or debugging, it is currently necessary to either:

* Include the source map's *absolute* URL in the WebAssembly binary when instantiating a module from a buffer or
* If the binary includes a *relative* URL, instantiate the WebAssembly binary with [WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/instantiateStreaming)

The exact source map URL included in the binary can be provided to `asc` as an argument to the `--sourceMap` parameter. Also note that WebAssembly source maps are not supported by all browsers, yet, but it is known that latest Firefox supports them.
