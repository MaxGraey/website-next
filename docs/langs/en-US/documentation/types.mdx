# Types

Instead of using the `number` type for all sorts of numeric values as in JS, AssemblyScript splits these up into more precise integer and floating point types that map directly to [WebAssembly types](http://webassembly.org/docs/semantics/#types).

Native types
------------

* **i32**/**u32**<br />
  A 32-bit signed respectively unsigned integer.

* **i64**/**u64**<br />
  A 64-bit signed respectively unsigned integer.

* **f32**<br />
  A 32-bit float.

* **f64**<br />
  A 64-bit float.

Emulated types
--------------

* **i8**/**u8**<br />
 An 8-bit signed respectively unsigned integer.

* **i16**/**u16**<br />
 A 16-bit signed respectively unsigned integer.

* **bool**<br />
  A 1-bit unsigned integer.

**Note** that emulated types are implicitly sign-extended respectively masked to handle overflows. When doing lots of mathematical operations, it is recommended to use native types within the calculations instead, storing the value back to an emulated type afterwards.

Target specific types
---------------------

* **isize**/**usize**<br />
  A 32-bit signed respectively unsigned integer when targeting 32-bit WebAssembly or a 64-bit signed respectively unsigned integer when targeting 64-bit WebAssembly. Equivalent to `void*`, `size_t` etc. in other languages.

**Note** that using target specific types might or might not require explicit casts depending on the target.

**Note** that WASM64 is a future feature ðŸ¦„ and not supported anywhere yet.

Special types
-------------

* **void**<br />
  Indicates that a function does not return a value.

Range limits
------------

The following range limits are present as global constants for convenience:

Constant                 | Value

f64.**EPSILON**: `f64` | 2.2204460492503131e-16

Assignability
-------------

Assigning a value of one type to a target of another type can be performed without explicit casts where the full range of possible values can be represented in the target type, regardless of interpretation/signedness:

| â†±       | bool | i8/u8 | i16/u16 | i32/u32 | i64/u64 | f32 | f64
|---------|------|-------|---------|---------|---------|-----|-----
| bool    | âœ“    | âœ“     | âœ“      | âœ“       | âœ“      | âœ“   | âœ“
| i8/u8   |      | âœ“     | âœ“      | âœ“       | âœ“       | âœ“  | âœ“
| i16/u16 |      |       | âœ“      | âœ“       | âœ“       | âœ“   | âœ“
| i32/u32 |      |       |         | âœ“       | âœ“       |    | âœ“
| i64/u64 |      |       |         |         | âœ“       |     |
| f32     |      |       |         |         |         | âœ“   | âœ“
| f64     |      |       |         |         |         |     | âœ“

Note that `isize/usize` act just like `i32/u32` if the target is WASM32 respectively as `i64/u64` if the target is WASM64.

**Example**

```ts
var i8val  : i8  = -128;  // 0x80
var u8val  : u8  = i8val; // becomes 128 (0x80)
var i16val : i16 = i8val; // becomes -128 through sign-extension (0xFF80)
var u16val : u16 = i8val; // becomes 65408 through masking (0xFF80)
var f32val : f32 = i8val; // becomes -128.0
```

Comparability
-------------

Comparing two values of different types can be performed without an explicit cast under the same rules as outlined in [assignability](#Assignability)

1. if the comparison is absolute (`==`, `!=`)
2. if the comparison is relative (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) and **both types have the same signedness**

because WebAssembly has distinct operations for signed and unsigned comparisons. The comparison uses the larger type and returns a `bool`.

Division and remainder
----------------------

Dividing or taking the remainder of dividing two values of different types can be performed without an explicit cast under the same rules as outlined in [assignability](#Assignability)

* if **both types have the same signedness**

because WebAssembly has distinct operations for signed and unsigned division and remainder. The result is of the larger type.

Bit shifts
----------

The result of a bit shift (`<<`, `>>`) is the left type, with the right type implicitly converted to the left type, performing an arithmetic shift if the left type is signed and a logical shift if the left type is unsigned.

The result of an unsigned right shift (`>>>`) is the left type (signedness is retained), with the right type implicitly converted to the left type, but always performing a logical shift.

If the left type is a float, an error is emitted.
