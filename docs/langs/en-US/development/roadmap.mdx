# Status / Roadmap

Current state of development is tracked in [GitHub projects](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/projects).

High level status
-----------------

* Most of TypeScript's AOT-compatible syntax is supported
* Manual memory management is in but GC remains to do
* Classes are still wonky when it comes to the details
* Standard library is very basic and needs a lot of work
* No exception support yet, waiting for [WebAssembly/exception-handling](https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling) to land
* We need more tests (pretty sure this will remain here)

High level goals
----------------

- [ ] Get a memory manager and GC combo up and running
  - [x] Memory manager
  - [ ] GC
- [ ] Get a standard library up that "just works" (where AOT-compatible)
- [ ] Improve linking, e.g. with C, based on what's supported by common tools
- [ ] Compile the AssemblyScript compiler to WebAssembly using itself
- [ ] Provide tools to automatically generate glue code and definitions

And, of course, keep up with the state of WebAssembly, most notably at this point:
